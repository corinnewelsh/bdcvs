BDCVS (Barking & Dagenham Council for Voluntary Service) is working in partnership with:
- BD Giving
- BD_Collective
- Barking Enterprise Centre (BEC)

We believe the complex issues of poverty, inequality and environmental crisis can only be solved through a deep collaborative approach.

The partnership is built across sectors drawing resources from public, private, voluntary, community, faith, and social enterprise routes. Working with local people to deliver a positive effect on people's lives and our neighbourhoods.

*Together we are stronger*.
