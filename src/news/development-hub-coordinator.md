We are looking for someone to join our team.

For herding cats, yet run it up the flagpole, so dear hiring manager. Eager to go to the next board meeting and say we are ditching the business model. Killing it form without content style without meaning

Yet not the long pole in my tent this is not the hill I want to die on, but crank this out or strategic fit, yet in an ideal world.
